``data_generator.py`` is meant to help the test case developer to generate
the test case data according the BOPTEST data convention. This convention 
consists of a set of keys for the boundary condition variables that are 
grouped in different categories. The names and grouping of these variables 
is established at the file ``categories.json`` of this directory.

The final goal of ``data_generator.py`` is to generate and introduce the 
CSV data files within the ``models/Resources`` folder of the test case 
in order to import these data later within the ``wrapped.fmu`` upon calling 
the ``Parser``. Therefore, the use of this module takes place before the 
parsing process. The test case developer is strongly encouraged to use this 
module, or at least follow it as a guideline when generating the test case 
data. However, the CSV data files can come from any other source as far as 
they comply with the three following requirements:

	1. The files should be located at ``models/Resources`` folder
	of the test case.
	2. The files should contain columns with keys following the 
	convention established at ``categories.json``
	3. The files should contain a ``time`` column specifying the 
	time from the beginning of the year in seconds.

In order to assist the test case developer in the generation of the data 
sets, the ``Data_Generator`` class contains several methods to generate 
the test case data grouped by categories and covering most of the common 
signal shapes which can still be tuned using certain arguments. 

On the other hand, the ``data_manager.py`` is used to introduce and 
retrieve the data into and from the test case ``wrapped.fmu``. It 
contains three main methods for this purpose:

	1. ``save_data_and_kpisjson`` saves all test case data located
	into the CSV files of the ``models/Resources`` folder of the 
	test case into the ``resources`` folder of the ``wrapped.fmu``.
	This method also saves the ``kpis.json`` file generated by the 
	``Parser`` within the same directory. This method is normally 
	employed by the ``Parser`` in the process of creating the 
	``wrapped.fmu`` of the test case.
	2. ``load_data_and_kpisjson`` reads the test case data and the 
	``kpis.json`` dictionary from the ``resources`` folder of the 	
	``wrapped.fmu`` and loads it into the test case object as a 
	pandas data frame and as a dictionary, respectively. This 
	method is normally employed by the constructor of a test case
	object in the process of initializing the test. 
	3. ``get_data`` slices the test case data frame to return the 
	data only for the requested index or period of time. This 
	method is normally employed by the ``KPI_Calculator`` or 
	``Forecaster`` classes.
